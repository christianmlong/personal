This is the python package containing the Pick Pack application. The application requires Twisted and Nevow. When run with the pickpack_dev.tac file, it serves a single-page web application on port 8082.

The interface is designed to be scanner-driven, so there is no visible text box for typing input. Hoewever, the appliction does accept typed input. Some example order numbers are AA00100, AA00300, and AA1230.
